# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`
and then 
### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

On the react app, you will get to see two options when you run it for the first time, these options are "Create Task" and a "search box".

Click on Create Task, and it will open a form where the user can enter his project details.

After a project is created, user can see it on the app and there is an option to edit and delete the project too.

When there are too many projects being created by the user, the user can search it by using any keyword from its project details.
